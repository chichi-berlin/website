description: >
     The Hook 2 is a CX and gravel bike, designed to keep on going even when the going gets tough. 
     Built on the foundations of the original Hook, which had proven itself to be beyond capable 
     having tackled the Transalp (endurance) mountain bike race and coming out totally unfazed. The 
     Hook 2 takes the proven Hook platform a step further, with front and rear thru-axles, double 
     butted Columbus tubing and full carbon, fender-ready fork. Versatility has been retained not 
     only in the geometry but also with the rear rack and fender mounts. The Hook 2 also features 
     the Quarq Prime crankset, being power meter ready means upgrading to these useful devices is 
     very straight for ward.
