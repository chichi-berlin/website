description: >
     Originally conceived as a more traditional road tourer the Audax has been transformed into a 
     vision for modern endurance road riding.Gone, are the traditional 700c wheels in favor of the 
     more compliant and equally fast 650B Adventure disc wheels courtesy of Hunt. The Audax uses 
     components selected for performance but with the solid reliability required for endurance 
     racing. The Shimano 105 is a true benchmark for any groupset and here on the Audax it keeps 
     things rolling efficiently whilst the TRP mechanical disc brakes provide plenty of power to 
     slow things down whenever needed.
