description: >
    Far from being a homage to the vintage cycling era, the Oxbridge is less velo-pastiche and more 
    cycling sophistication. Looking beyond the dark metallic paint and into the fabric of the bike, 
    the Oxbridge is a daily companion. Made with quality materials and components means the Oxbridge 
    can be used all year round, be it a city commuting or relaxed weekend jollies.
    Finished in a deep metallic British Racing Green, with polished components and leather saddle, 
    the Oxbridge is understated yet oozing style. Designed for cruising in style, the simple single 
    speed drivetrain is easy to maintain, meaning you can just relax and enjoy the ride. The 
    comfortable riding position keeps you more upright to observe what’s going on around you, ideal 
    when mixing with the traffic. Color-coded alloy fenders are rattle-free and keep you dry when 
    the weather inevitably takes a turn for the worse.
