description: >
    1/8” chain breaker for track and fixed gear applications. This 1/8” chain breaker works as well 
    as the Park Tools CT2 but doesn’t cost the earth. The burly handle along with over sized head 
    ensures this tool will break even the burliest BMX chains without you breaking a sweat. Tough 
    enough for the use in even the busiest workshops and affordable enough to be found in the bottom 
    of every cyclists back pack. Features replaceable pins.
