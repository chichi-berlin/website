description: >
    Lets face it, every cyclist needs Hex (or Allen) keys. Multi tools are great for out and about, 
    but when at home the extra length of a full Allen Key set is often a necessity. BLB is proud to 
    offer all the useful attributes of an Allen Key set, but with the added bonus of a fantastic 
    array of colours. Working on your bike doesnâ€™t have to be grey, we know a colourful toolset will 
    always make us smile.
