description: >
     The Needle is all about balance. In Crit racing you need a bike that has enough stiffness to 
     ensure it reacts to your every input, but with enough ‘give’ to absorb the rougher surfaces of 
     a typical Crit circuit. It’s for this reason that the Needle uses steel, rather than alloy or 
     carbon fiber for its frame. Every detail of this bike has been considered and optimized thanks 
     to input from the guys racing it week in, week out. Features like a shorter seat tube, to allow 
     the seat post a little more flex, keeping you firmly planted in the saddle, or the optimized 
     trail length for greater stability at high speeds. The components and finishing kit on the 
     Needle are all race ready, from the SRAM Omnium crankset to the Bombtrack developed Drome 
     wheels. All this means the Needle is ready to head straight for the nearest Crit race and mix 
     things up in more ways than one.
