description: >
   The Experience is Cinelli’s flagship aluminium road racing frame: a continuously fine-tuned Italian racing machine with maniacally designed details that reflect Cinelli’s intimate knowledge of metal race bikes. At the heart of the Experience’s all-purpose race feel is the Columbus triple-butted Airplane tubing developed by the same engineers that pioneered the lightest aluminium tubesets in the history of cycling in the 1990s, at the height of the material’s technological innovation. The Airplabe tubeset is composed of radically thin seatstays (12mm diameter) and 27,2 seatpost complemented by oversized downtube (50mm diameter) and chainstays (28,6mm) resulting in an extremely comfortable but mechanically efficient lightweight racing bicycle that is fast enough to ride hard on, but versatile enough to transform into a performance-commuter.
