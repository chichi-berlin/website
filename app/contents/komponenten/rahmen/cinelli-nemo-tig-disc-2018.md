description: >
   The Nemo TIG is Cinelli’s latest Made in Italy high-performance steel road frame. It looks and rides the way in which the legendary Supercorsa – the world’s longest running production steel frame – might have looked had it been designed for racing today rather than in the 1950s.
   The first prototypes of this frame were born according to the specifications of a recently retired Italian professional rider working at Cinelli who, seduced by the Columbus tubing being manufactured on the factory floor attached to the Cinelli offices, demanded that Cinelli produce a pure racing steel frame that took full advantage of the latest advances in high tech steel tubing manufacturing.
   Accordingly the Nemo has been designed for riders used to riding high-end carbon fiber racing frames, unwilling to sacrifice “race feeling”, but looking for something incomparably pleasurable to ride in the way only a steel frame can be. It employs custom-shaped Columbus Spirit triple-butted tubes (the seat stays, for example, are the identical shape of those found on the original 1981 Cinelli Laser road model), with a highly contemporary 44mm mega-oversized downtube, conical CNC’d head tube and Columbus’ latest Futura straight blade monocoque carbon fiber fork.
   In the spirit of its older cousin, the Supercorsa, the Nemo is available not only made-to-measure, but also in 60 different colour options.
