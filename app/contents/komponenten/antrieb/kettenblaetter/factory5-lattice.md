description: >
    F5 went back to the drawing board with this one and came up with something technically innovative and intrinsically beautiful. In other words, it's freaking light and euphemistically gorgeous.
    Precision CNC milled from a single piece of 7075 aluminium, the dual-plane cutouts maintain strength whilst  reducing the chainring's weight to a mere 78g. Radially brushed the ring and had them deep anodized to give the industrial feel... and the result is something we're chuffed to say is made in China.
    Supplied without chainring bolts.
